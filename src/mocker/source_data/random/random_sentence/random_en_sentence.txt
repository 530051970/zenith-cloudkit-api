I was right here , ' ' he said standing at the spot where he had received the ball for the kick .

I just hit through and I was punching the air before the ball got there .

" I do n't think one should have expected more than what one got , " he said . "
That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all . "
The commission , which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses , has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds .
" A person can be forced to appear , but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee .
At the moment this is not the case . "
His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that .
" This whole thing is utterly useless , it does n't help us at all .
What the people expect is to have houses , to have jobs . "
" Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation .
One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary , " he said .

This is a protest of warning and the next step is entering our town using all means possible , so let them shoot . "

No going back on democracy ; attempts to tamper with security and stability will not be tolerated .
- State security court starts investigating suspects in unrest .
- Cabinet puts off decision on foreign workers .
A thin trickle of voters began casting their ballots in this northern port city for the five rival lists of candidates as polling stations opened at 7 a.m. ( 0400 gmt ) .
What it comes down to is this : If you 're highly skilled , you 'll benefit nicely .
But if you 're not and cannot contribute to your employer 's goals , you 'll be paid less .
In the future , the accountant will be evaluated solely on " knowledge , skill and abilities , " she said .
In addition to using accounting skills , the accountant will also have to be creative , work well in a team , be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals .
" The bad news is , if you 're not skilled and ca n't contribute to a team , to customer service and the organisation 's goals , you 'll be paid less . "
Of the 750 mid-to-large size corporations surveyed , 81 percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years , and more than two-thirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result .
Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure , and 78 percent report that they are considering a new , skills-based plan for both management and non-management employees .
It 's an inexorable change . "
But as the economy became global , customers were more demanding and problems became more complex .
Now organisations must change to stay competitive .
If your team does well , you 'll do well .
If it does n't do well , do n't expect a raise .
Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca n't keep up ?
It 's not a question we ask any more .
The more important question is -- ' Do we have results ? '
"
To get those results , 27 percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives , such as employee and team award programmes and education .
For example , the survey rated some participants in the survey as " high-performing " companies , based on their return on equity above 16 percent .
Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education , give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success .
" The key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership .
It will improve a company 's bottom line . "
He was promoted to chief detective earlier this year .
The budget had been widely expected a week or so later .
Five people died later in hospital .
The radio said on Sunday the postponement of the opening had been made due to " precautions " .
It did not elaborate .
Police used batons and teargas to try to disperse students who were throwing stones and home-made bombs , witnesses said .
Local officials said one policeman was killed by gunshots during clashes with pro-opposition students on Thursday .
Police stormed ten residence halls on the campus , flushed out people at gunpoint and searched their baggage .
They seized revolvers , sawn-off rifles , shotguns and knives .
The students were later allowed to return .
Authorities closed down the 28,000-student university on Wednedsay following gunbattles between students and police .
Two died later in hospital .
The country 's grain harvest this year is forecast to fall by more than 23 percent to only 28 million tonnes and two harsh factors are to blame .
A drought scoured the steppes in May and June , stunting the growing wheat .
We 've never seen anything so bad , " he said in an interview in his office , unlit since the government cut off electricity because of unpaid power bills .
This year 's harvest is down from last year 's 36.5 million tonne harvest , which in turn compares with 50 million tonnes in 1990 , the year before independence .
He said his farm , its 260 workers now readying the fields for winter wheat sowing , expected the land to yield 5.2 tonnes per hectare ( 2.5 acres ) but ended up with 3.9 tonnes -- still better than the national average of 2.11 tonnes per hectare this year .
People are working out of their own dedication . "
He said the government plans to increase the sowing of the winter wheat which will be harvested next year .
Collective farms will last for the next few years , because most private farms now only produce enough to feed themselves with maybe a little extra to sell , said one private farmer : " In the future , maybe , but it 's better not to hurry .
" Collectivisation brought us a lot of pain .
And it went too fast .
Privatising too quickly can also have a negative outcome . "
" Not everything has gone well .
We 've had substantial production difficulties at a number of our operations .
Not only did the company lock in 3.92 rand per dollar in February / March , but it suffered output losses due to a furnace shutdown last August .
The rand was last bid at 4.5350 against the dollar .
" The big disappointment for the year was the failure of the platinum merger .
The group is soundly structured and prudently financed and is blessed with an excellent portfolio of world-class businesses .
I think we can look forward to further growth " .
" We 've tried to clean up our overall portfolio by disposing of non-core assets .
Overall a very substantial pruning ...
He added that the group still had about 85 million rand after tax invested in various shares , which were market for disposal when required .
When we bought the shares we bought ...
at quite a bit lower than the price is now ...
maybe if we just wait another few years for the next downturn in coal . "

The combined company will have estimated revenues of $ 353 million .

It did not say when the charge would be taken .
The merger will add to both companies ' historical leadership in infusion therapy and technology-based drug delivery devices , they said .

Perhaps the advisory was cut off before concluding : " ...and bring plenty of money . "
When the tournament began on Monday it was the fans ' turn to be offended .
Indeed , a nice glass of chardonnay or white zinfandel was going for $ 4.75 , while an imported beer was just a bit more than the water at $ 4.50 .
What 's the message here ? "
Fans will be shelling out $ 12.50 for a hamburger and a large french fries .

( Corrects to make clear a reorganization plan has been filed ) .
The reorganization plan calls for all secured claims to be paid in full .
Unsecured claims , including those of company bondholders , will be satisfied by issuing new common stock and warrants .
Unsecured claims are estimated at about $ 90 million .

Between 4.75 and 3.13 million shares will be allocated to bondholders and other unsecured non-trade creditors and 200,000 will be allocated to existing shareholders in exchange for all existing stock of the company .
Bondholders and other unsecured non-trade creditors will receive warrants four about 2.2 million shares when the company 's market capitalization reaches $ 20 million .
Bondholders , other unsecured non-trade creditors , and existing shareholders also will receive warrants entitling them to roughly 800,000 shares when the company 's market capitalization reaches $ 25 million .
Management will receive options to purchase 10 percent of the company 's outstanding common stock with protection against dilution at an option exercise price of $ 1 million .

He returned at the weekend , pledging to conclude a political settlement that would make this truce work where all others have failed .
But then he apparently thought better of it .
It is not known what caused the delay in the peace plan .
A rebel spokesman said the two military men had come close to agreement on a face-saving formula acceptable to both sides and involving a referendum on independence at some future date .
He would continue working on various documents and might meet " one state offical or another " .

" We are united and we are waiting for the government to decide what to do with us . "
Trade unions demanded payment of June and July wages and last year 's holiday pay , and called on government to develop a revival programme for the plant .
" But there is a significant influence of opposition parties that are collecting points ahead of coming elections . "
The party official said the union 's figure on the number of protesters was exaggerated . "
There were about 1,400 to 1,600 people at the protest today -- much less then last week .
" But there were more observers and passers by , " he said .
Insurers ' five-10 and 10-15 day loans were made at a steady 8.0 percent after last week 's drop from an earlier 15 percent .

Fiscal policy was expected to be loosened a bit in the second half of this year , boosting growth without running into a deficit .
" Next year , the fiscal policy will have less margin of freedom because the government will have to face commitments that it has taken on under different support schemes for the banks , debtors and firms , " the brokerage said .
" We have a suitable exchange rate .
We have n't felt a drop-off in demand ....
It was the second consecutive session that saw the peso , which ended at 1,041 Friday , close lower .
" The ( dollar 's ) rise was due to demand from importers who have a lot of wire transfers accumulated , " one dealer said .
Contributing to the peso 's weakness , another dealer said banks who might have sold greenbacks in Monday 's trading appeared to shy away from the market .
Dealers reported 355 trades for a total of $ 142 million and said the peso hit an intra-day high of 1,037 before heading lower into the close .

Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,342.00 / 42.45 and 2,341.5 / 42.0 , respectively .

The liquidity at month-end and the next court hearing scheduled for Thursday , " the dealer said .
The hearing is due to resume on Thursday .

" We expect reasonable growth in the second half .
He said growth in customer demand in the first half was 50 percent above normal but it was hard to maintain this pace .
The bank earlier warned that profit growth would slow in the second half , citing the increasing momentum in profit growth in the comparative period of 1995 and increased investment .

The president of parliament had earlier said September 11 could be set for the debate .
His critics allege he may be attempting to delay the debate .
" In my opinion September 18 would be a convenient date for the government to answer questions .
" We are still waiting to fix a date .
September 18 is regarded as tentative because we still have not received the order to fix it on the agenda , " said an official at parliament 's agenda section .

Almost no chance at all for any complete ticket to win altogether and the results will weaken some leaders .
- The surprise ...
- Prices of alimentary goods up 13.4 percent in 1996 .
- Visitors slam bus and taxi drivers for cheating .
- Government considering measures for better road discipline .
But it recovered at the close of trade .
Consequently , stocks and bonds are both subject to rapid swings . "
The market is trading 100 percent on fundamentals at the moment as interest rate fantasy disappears -- it 's all company news , " said one trader .
There is still the summer malaise hanging over the market . "

Later they said the number of passengers released from the plane had reached 80 .
As well as financial threats , companies also emphasise the " terror " tactics used .
But it 's when it gets to the ( employee ) families -- that it goes across the line . "
But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic , pollution and damage local communities .
The government has slashed its road-building spending .
Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological .
" But they are more alert than they were 3-4 years ago .
There 's no doubt it 's a big issue now . "
He says the damage comes in two forms : " Tangible -- in the form of extra costs , additional security , threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity . "
" I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss . "
Hundreds of thousands of pounds ( dollars ) of damage was done in one day .
Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future . "
As a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security . "
For an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins , overcapacity and stagnant demand , eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector 's tale of woe .
Police said they made 30 arrests and there were two stabbings .
But there was no repeat of the ugly scenes that used to scar the street festival , and police praised the crowds over the two days of festivities as good-natured .
Around 400 police were wounded in riots in 1976 when the carnival , now in its 31st year , acquired its darker reputation from which it is now only slowly recovering .
Shopkeepers still board up their windows and many residents leave town for the weekend , but for four or five years there has been no disorder and relatively little crime .

We have no idea why they are being held .
We are still trying to establish contact with the local commander . "
But the church learned in a recent meeting with the local commander that no instructions to release the prisoners were received and they would be held until investigations were completed .
The evening of the same day the missionaries were put in prison or isolation .
Later the mission was looted , " it added .
He said no exact date had been set but it was possible the local elections would take place in the spring of 1997 .
Diplomats say the effect of the electoral engineering would be to establish political control over districts they conquered and ethnically cleansed in war .
However , tension on the ground indicates that it could falter if the momentum for a settlement is not maintained .
Aides have dismissed such speculation , insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign .
It was their fourth meeting this year .
We might also help them to do it , if they go on like this , " he said .
A third and final vote was due to be held when parliament reconvened on Tuesday but legislators were not expecting a clear result .
If there is no result the decision will be ceded to an electoral college .
Under a constitution agreed in 1992 , a year after independence , the president has no executive powers .
His only political role is to smoothe the functioning of government in periods of crisis .
His relations with a leftist-led government have sometimes been tense .
His support in the first round of voting on Monday was much lower than expected , scoring only 45 votes , which political analysts put down as a vote of no confidence in his performance .
This support only inched up to 49 in the second vote .
Parliamentary organisers said the exact timetable remained unclear but it would probably take about a month to organise an electoral college which could also hold several rounds of voting before a clear winner emerges .
The final decision will now be made by a larger assembly .
The election will now go before an electoral college involving MPs and local government representatives that will be convened by the parliamentary Speaker in the next day or so .
It could take up to a month before a new vote but the timetable is not yet clear .
He could face up to five years in jail if convicted .
The prosecutor 's office said no date had yet been set for a trial to begin as investigations had first to be completed .
To win a clear mandate for the five-year presidential term , a candidate must secure 68 votes from the 101-member parliament .
If a third round of voting fails to give either candidate 68 votes , the parliamentary speaker has to convene an electoral college of all 101 MPs and 273 local government representatives for a new vote that could take up to a month .
" The police suspect ( the girls ) were under the influence of drugs as some girls admitted they took unspecified pills . "
Last Saturday he led police to the bodies of two other girls , aged eight , who died of starvation this year after their abduction in June , 1995 .
In the latest attack , the killer raped and stabbed a young woman in a lift , leaving her body on a landing .
Police earlier released a suspect after women who had survived an attack failed to identify him .
Depending on you , we will either live or die , " it said .
The two were held for 71 days until relatives paid a ransom .
Two of the suspected abductors have since been arrested .
" We do n't believe the government will make its timetable , " he added .
" We oppose any privatization that hurts workers ' welfare and does not take into account its social impact , " they said .
Enraged drunks and street people in this town known for its machismo have organised a so-far unsuccessful search for the culprit who finds victims in the dark streets surrounding a local market .

" There are still patients hospitalised and problems which must be dealt with , " a city spokesman said , citing the issue of whether to allow children infected with the bacteria but not showing symptoms to attend school from September .
The outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation 's school lunch programme .
The ministers agreed at Tuesday 's cabinet meeting to step up inspection measures for school lunches in September and October , when schools around the country resume .
The surge reflected strong demand from the beverage can and housing construction sectors , federation officials said .

July inventories stood at 75,632 tonnes , down 2.6 percent from the prior month .

The so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last September , were approved in a 4-0 vote .
The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time .
Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock .
In a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices .
It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market .
It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems , thus robbing investors without access to " hidden " quotes the benefit of the best available prices .
The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the " price improvement " proposal again .
The decree plugs a legal void in which magistrates could have forced the former prime minister to take one of the three stations he controls off the air because of a court ruling that no single proprietor should be allowed to keep three channels .

Doctors and medical staff from a hospital across the road from the station were at the scene of the accident within minutes and were able to treat the injured quickly , he added .
Analysts said livestock production would likely shift to the eastern Prairie rather than feed grains being shipped to the western Prairie .

Researchers report progress in muscular dystrophy .
Several hurdles must be overcome before the method is used in human trials .
Muscular dystrophy is a fatal illness in which the body 's muscle tissue degenerates and is replaced by fat .
Death strikes in early adulthood .
Individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin .
The virus , which also was altered to minimise its susceptibility to the immune system , was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes .
In the experiment , between 30 to 40 percent of the muscle fibers in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing .
Similar results had been obtained previously in test-tube cell cultures , but not in live animals , the university said .
The university said methods are still needed to make enough of the altered virus to treat humans , to further decrease the immune-system response to the virus , and to deliver the virus to human muscle tissue .
